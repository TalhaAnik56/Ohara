# Ohara - E-commerce Bookstore (Frontend)

Welcome to Ohara! This repository contains the frontend codebase for an e-commerce platform dedicated to buying and selling books. It's developed using React 18 with TypeScript.

Please note: This repository specifically addresses the frontend part of the project and is currently in the development phase. Expect ongoing updates and improvements.


## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Implementing login and logout functionality for users.
- **Customer and Seller Segregation:** Each user will have a separate ID as either a customer or a seller. The same ID cannot serve as both a customer and a seller.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add or remove items, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout seamlessly for secure payment processing.
- **Book Ordering and Listing:** Users can browse available books, place orders, and list their own books for sale.
- **Standard E-commerce Features:** The platform will include other typical e-commerce functionalities common to such web applications.
- **Product Catalog:** Explore a diverse catalog showcasing available books, including categories, titles, authors, descriptions, and images.
- **Search and Filter:** Easily find books by title, writer, and genre. Apply filters to refine search results based on price range.
- **Product Details:** Access detailed information about each book, including price, condition, available quantity, ratings, and reviews.
- **User Profiles:** Manage personal information, view order history, and update preferences via individual user accounts.
- **Order Management:** View order status, confirmations, and shipment details conveniently.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Securely complete purchases using digital wallets, or other payment methods.
- **Reviews and Ratings:** Share experiences by leaving reviews and ratings for purchased books, assisting others in making informed decisions.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring an intuitive and accessible user interface across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Notifications:** Receive timely email notifications for order confirmations, shipping updates, and other pertinent alerts.
- **Customer Support:** Access customer service channels such as FAQs, or helpdesk for assistance with inquiries or issues.
- **Caching:** Ohara implements a robust caching mechanism to enhance performance and user experience. This caching system optimizes the retrieval and storage of frequently accessed data, reducing load times and improving overall responsiveness within the platform.


  ### Trading Feature
In addition to the standard e-commerce functionalities, Ohara introduces a trading feature where users can post books for trade. These posted books will be visible in the trading list, enabling other users to browse and express interest in a particular book. If a user finds a book they're interested in, they can directly message the owner of the book to initiate a potential trade arrangement.

These features collectively contribute to an enhanced and user-centric e-commerce environment, fostering seamless interactions between buyers and sellers within the Ohara platform.
